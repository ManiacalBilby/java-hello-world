# java-hello-world

I chose to look into creating a basic Java app using Spring Boot through my interest in companies who work with Java such as Home Depot.

Getting up and running requires the intallation of Java JDK, Maven or Gradle(I used Maven) and a text editor of choice(I used VSCode).

Java was created by James Gosling beginning in 1991 and was officially release to the public in 1995 by Sun Microsystems. Sun Microsystems began the process of releasing the Java virtual machine in 2006 as open-source and completed this in 2007. Java is currently managed by Oracle after acquiring Sun Microsystems in 2009.
Java is an Object Oriented Programming language with similarites to C and more so C++.

I found coding in Java similar to creating classes in other language but with much more specificity involved when declaring classes and variables. I was pleased to be able to jump into another language and make comparisons to languages already learned in order to successfully use and understand the code I wrote.

Here are some resources to get started with Java and Spring:

In order to run this I used "brew install Maven" and followed the instructions in the above Spring tutorial. 
You should be able to run this code with Maven installed with the command mvn spring-boot:run ran within the main app folder.
